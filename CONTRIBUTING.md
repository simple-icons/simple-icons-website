### Using Docker

You can build a Docker image for this project from the Dockerfile. This image can be used to instantiate a container serving the simple-icons website. If you attach the container to the project folder local changes will be reflected by the this webserver.

```bash
# Navigate to the project root
$ cd simple-icons-website

# Build the Docker image for the simple-icons-website (if you haven't yet)
$ docker build . -t simple-icons/website

# Start a container running `npm run serve:watch` in the background. The value
# of the --volume option ensures local changes in /public folder are reflected
# by the webserver
$ docker run -d -p 8080:8080 --rm --volume $PWD/public:/website/public --name simple-icons-webserver simple-icons/website

# Inspect the server logs
$ docker logs simple-icons-webserver

# Stop the server (and delete the container)
$ docker stop simple-icons-webserver
```

Alternatively, you can use it to create a container and attach to it. This would allow you to use it as a development environment.

```bash
# Start a container and attach a shell
$ docker run -it --entrypoint "/bin/ash" --name simple-icons-website-dev simple-icons/website

# Do anything you want, e.g. linting the source code
/website$ npm run lint

# Remove the container when you don't need it anymore
$ docker rm simple-icons-website-dev
```
